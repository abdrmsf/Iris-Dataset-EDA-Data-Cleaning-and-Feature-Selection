# Iris Dataset - EDA, Data Cleaning & Feature Selection

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project analyzes the classic **Iris dataset** containing 150 samples of three iris species 
(*Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica*). Each sample includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, 
petal length, and petal width.

## ðŸ”Ž Steps Performed
- **EDA:** Visualized feature distributions, correlations, and class separability.
- **Data Cleaning:** Verified no missing values or duplicates, ensured correct data types.
- **Feature Selection:** Identified petal length and petal width as the most important predictors.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## ðŸŽ¯ Outcome
A clean dataset with selected features ready for machine learning tasks such as 
classification and predictive modeling.
